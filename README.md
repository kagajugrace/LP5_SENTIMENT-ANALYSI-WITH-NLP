# SENTIMENT-ANALYSI-WITH-NLP AND HUGGING FACE

## Overview
- This project was introduction to sentiment analysis with Natural Language Processing

## Background
- This project gave me the opportunity to fine-tune a pre-trained Deep Learning models from HuggingFace on a new dataset to modify models to predict the sentiments from twitter display neutral, positive, negative for the end-user. A streamlit app was then created and models trained was integrated to deploy the app on the HuggingFace platform.

The streamlit app end-user displays or expressed an input text and displays a visual representation of the sentiment scores.
